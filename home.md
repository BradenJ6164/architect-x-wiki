# Welcome to the SCP Architect X Wiki!
## Basic Information
SCP: Architect X is a ROBLOX Sandbox Tycoon game developed by KZ Industries which focuses and based on the Special Containment Procedures Foundation (SCP Foundation) collaborative fictional universe. SCP: Architect X allows you to take the role of a Site Director who builds their own SCP Facility from the ground up, with a focus on micro-management.

SCP: Architect X decides to throw out the monotony of regular repetitive tycoon games, and allows YOU to create the Containment Site you always wanted, putting you in the shoes and making you really feel  like an Architect of your own creation.
