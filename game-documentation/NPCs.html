<h1>NPCs</h1>
<p><strong>NPCs (non-player character)s</strong> in SCP Architect X serve many functions for your foundation.</p>
<p><strong>NPCs are meant to be predictable, and have limited random properties or decisions unless explicitly stated</strong>.</p>
<h2>Current NPCs</h2>
<p>This is a list of current NPCs within the game, their function, and cost to hire.</p>
<figure class="table">
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>NPC Name</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Function</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Cost</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Scientist</td>
        <td>Performs tests using test subjects.</td>
        <td>$1000+</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Security</td>
        <td>Required for testing Euclid humanoid SCPs.</td>
        <td>$1500+</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Test Subject</td>
        <td>Required for tests to occur. Automatically hired when old bed is placed.</td>

<h2>NPC Metrics</h2>
<p>NPCs have 3 major metrics, <strong>Bathroom, Hunger, &amp; Energy.</strong></p>

      <tr>
        <td><strong>Metric</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Bathroom</td>
        <td>The bathroom metric shows the accessibility and use of toilets for NPCs.&nbsp;<br>To increase this metric, you should place more toilets across your facility.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Hunger</td>
        <td>The hunger metric shows the accessibility and use of cafeteria tables for NPCs.<br>To increase this metric, you should place and link more cafeterias across your facility.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Energy</td>
        <td>The energy metric shows the amount of rest and use of beds for NPCs.<br>To increase this metric, ensure all staff and test subjects have a sufficient amount of beds.</td>
      </tr>

<h2>NPC Prices</h2>
<p>The cost of hiring scientists and security grows exponentially as you hire.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>The base cost for scientists is <strong>$1000</strong></li>
  <li>The base cost for security is <strong>$1500</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>Math</h3>
<p>The prices for NPC's are determined by this</p>
<p>f(c,n)=round(c⋅1.4n)f(c, n) = \mathrm{round}(c \cdot 1.4^n) f(c,n)=round(c⋅1.4n)</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>ccc - base cost (1000 for Scientist and 1500 for security)</p>
<p>nnn - number of NPCs (of whichever type you're buying) that you already have</p>
<p>In this provided function, it's raising 1.4 (the scaling factor / growth rate) to the nnn and then multiplying it by ccc followed by rounding it to a whole number</p>
<p>Think of ccc as the base cost,<br>and 1.4n1.4^n1.4n as the inflation multiplier that increases the price each time you buy another one.</p>
<p>The total cost of buying nnn NPCs:</p>
<p>total(c,n)=round(c⋅1.4n−11.4−1)\text{total}(c, n) = \mathrm{round}\left(c \cdot \frac{1.4^n - 1}{1.4 - 1}\right) total(c,n)=round(c⋅1.4−11.4n−1​)</p>
<h1>NPC Behavior</h1>
<p>Outlined below is the static behavior of every NPC. An NPC's lifecycle is a loop of actions and decisions an NPC will make during it's life time (from hiring to firing).</p>
<p>// for braden to do when behavior trees are implemented</p>
