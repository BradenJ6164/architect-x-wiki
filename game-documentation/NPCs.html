<h1>NPCs</h1>
<p><strong>NPCs (no player character)s </strong>in SCP Architect X serve many functions for your foundation.</p>
<p><span class="text-big"><mark class="pen-red"><strong>NPCs are meant to be predictable, and have limited random properties or decisions unless explicitly stated</strong>.</mark></span></p>
<h1>NPC Behavior</h1>
<p>Outlined below is the static behavior of every NPC. An NPC's lifecycle is a loop of actions and decisions an NPC will make during it's life time (from hiring to firing). If a lifecycle fails at any action, it will immediately jump to the failure action and then attempt to restart the lifecycle.</p>
