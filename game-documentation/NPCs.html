<h1>NPCs</h1>
<p><strong>NPCs (no player character)s </strong>in SCP Architect X serve many functions for your foundation.</p>
<p><span class="text-big"><strong>NPCs are meant to be predictable, and have almost no random properties or decisions unless explicitly stated</strong>.</span></p>
<h1>NPC Behavior</h1>
<p>Outlined below is the static behavior of every NPC. An NPC's lifecycle is a loop of actions and decisions an NPC will make during it's life time (from hiring to firing). If a lifecycle fails at any action, it will immediately jump to the failure action and then attempt to restart the lifecycle.</p>
<h2>Scientist</h2>
<p><strong>Lifecycle:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Do Test - Always Succeeds</li>
  <li>Do Test &nbsp;- Always Succeeds</li>
  <li>Go Eat</li>
  <li>Research - Always Succeeds</li>
  <li>Research - Always Succeeds</li>
  <li>Go Sleep</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>On Fail</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Roam</li>
</ul>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p><strong>Lifecycle:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Patrol - Always Succeeds</li>
  <li>Patrol - Always Succeeds</li>
  <li>Go Eat</li>
  <li>Patrol - Always Succeeds</li>
  <li>Patrol - Always Succeeds</li>
  <li>Go Sleep</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>On Fail</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Roam</li>
</ul>
<h2>Class D</h2>
<p>Class Ds work differently from other NPCs. Class Ds are considered child NPCs. These NPCs often have a parent such as a Scientist or Security NPC. The given parent of a Class D can change at any time. When the Class D is assigned a parent, it's lifecycle is temporarily paused for later resumption.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Lifecycle:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Random:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Use Toilet</li>
      <li>Go Sleep</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>On Fail:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Nothing</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
