<h2>Maintenance&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The <strong>Maintenance</strong> skin is an industrial-themed structure that features tubes and electrical wires strung across it's walls. It's intended for maintenance-shaft and other similar zones, but is universal enough to be used in a plethora of ways and ideas.</p>
<p>This skin contains sub-variants, such as half-walls and walls w/ integrated lights.</p>
