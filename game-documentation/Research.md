# Research

Research in SCP Architect X allows players to unlock new features within the game. Each feature unlock requires a certain amount of research stars.

## Research Tree

The Research Tree is accessible by the microscope icon in the bottom left-center of the toolbar. It displays the amount of research stars you have and the features you can (or have) unlocked.

## Research Stars

Research stars are given every time you level up. You can level up by increasing your XP, where one test is equal to one XP given. To check your XP level till next level-up, click the level button in the bottom left of the toolbar.
