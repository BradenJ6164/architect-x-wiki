<h1>SCPs</h1>
<p>SCPs (formerly Anomalies) in SCP Architect X are the backbone of any facility. These are these anomalous items and/or humanoids that your facility is built to contain and research using Class D personnel.<br><br>Each SCP has it's own test interactions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ad60fpv_dK0">See this player-made video by <strong>niktyethbradman (@bluee5758)</strong>!&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>SCPs are placed under 3 different categories found below:</p>
<h1>Safe</h1>
<p>Safe-class SCPs are anomalies that are easily and safely contained. This is often due to the fact that the Foundation has researched the SCP well enough that containment does not require significant resources or that the anomalies require a specific and conscious activation or trigger. Classifying an SCP as Safe, however, does not mean that handling or activating it does not pose a threat.</p>
<h2>SCP-005</h2>
<p><strong>Object Description:</strong> <i>"SCP 005 is a key thing... The 05 council isn't really sure what it does. Whatever it is it's probably harmless and surely won't have any negative effects for anyone. The government doesn't really care"</i></p>
<p><strong>Cost: </strong>$1,000</p>

<h1>Euclid</h1>
<p>Euclid-class SCPs are anomalies that require more resources to contain completely or where containment isn't always reliable. Usually this is because the SCP is insufficiently understood or inherently unpredictable. Euclid is the Object Class with the greatest scope, and it's usually a safe bet that an SCP will be this class if it doesn't easily fall into any of the other standard Object Classes.</p>

<h3>SCP-2883</h3>

<h3>SCP-4854</h3>

<h1>Keter</h1>
<p>Keter-class SCPs are anomalies that are exceedingly difficult to contain consistently or reliably, with containment procedures often being extensive and complex. The Foundation often can't contain these SCPs well due to not having a solid understanding of the anomaly, or lacking the technology to properly contain or counter it. A Keter SCP does not mean the SCP is dangerous, just that it is simply very difficult or costly to contain.</p>
<p><strong>There are currently no Keter class SCPs in SCP Architect X</strong></p>
