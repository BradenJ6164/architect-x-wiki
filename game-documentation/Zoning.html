<h1>Zoning</h1>
<p><strong>Zoning </strong>is a core concept in Architect X, that defines your tycoon's areas. In order to have furnishing objects such as tables, chairs, beds, and desks they must be configured in a proper zone. You can delete and place as many zones as you need. You can also create zones in a convex-concave polygon. When a zone is placed, an interface shows the requirements for the zone to be valid. For any of the zone's objects to be functional, the zone <strong>must </strong>be valid. Be mindful that some zone types have a maximum number of objects, and those will be outlined below and presented in game.</p>
<h2>Class D Cell</h2>
<p>The Class D Cell will simply define a cell. You have the option to use an Old Bed or Old Bunk Bed. The Old Bunk Bed will provide two Class D slots. Upon successful completion of a zone, Class D's will automatically be issued to the foundation. See the <a href="/game-documentation/Events">Foundation Life Cycle</a> for more information.</p>
