<h1>Linking</h1>
<p><strong>Linking</strong> is a core concept in Architect X, that defines how a specific object or piece of furniture will function in your tycoon. In order to have furnishing objects such as tables, chairs, beds, and desks work for your personnel, some must be linked to specific objects to allow for personnel to use it. You can link as many furnishings as you need to each other and clicking the same furnishing you clicked will instead un-link the object.</p>
<h2>Creating a Link</h2>
<p>Not all objects will require linking to be used by staff. Objects that require linking will have a red triangle warning symbol.<br><br>Upon clicking the warning, you will be prompted to link that object to another object. The game will also show you what the correct linking object is at the bottom, as it will be the only thing you can place while in linking mode.</p>
<h2>List of Possible Links</h2>
<p>This is a list of the possible links and their function within the game.</p>

<p>Note that some host objects can serve their own function when not linked to.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Computer Desks</strong>, when not linked, are used for post-test research for scientists (yields higher earnings)</li>
  <li><strong>Toilet or Toilet Combo</strong>, when not linked, is used by staff when needed.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>1. The first version of linking was instead called “Zoning” which had objects placed inside zones, but the idea was scrapped.</p>
