<h1>Linking</h1>
<p><strong>Linking </strong>is a core concept in Architect X, that defines your tycoon's main necessities for rooms / areas. In order to have furnishing objects such as tables, chairs, beds, and desks work for your personnel, they must be linked to specific objects to allow for personnel to use it. You can link as many furnishings as you need to each other and clicking the same furnishing you clicked will instead un-link the object.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Creating a Link</h3>
<p>When placing an object, one of three things will happen.</p>
<p>1. Nothing will happen. Instead, this becomes a link-to object. This object can be classified as a “host” object because many other objects can link to it.</p>
<p>2. An error pop-up will appear. When this happens, you have to link it to a “host" object for it to function. This object can be classified as a “Parasite” object because it requires a “host”.</p>
<p>3. Nothing will happen, but this time linking to other items will not be possible. This object can be classified as an “isolate” object because it does not require linking nor can it link.</p>
<p>These “host”, “parasite”, and “Isolate” names are not official, only a neat way to understand how each object works.</p>
<h2>‘Host’ Objects</h2>
<p>Currently, there are three host objects.</p>
<p>1. The Kitchen Buffet, which can be linked into the cafeteria table.</p>
<p>2. The Toilet, which can be linked into the old bed. The toilet may also be classified as an “Isolate” object.</p>
<p>3. The Desk, which can be linked into any safe or Euclid SCPs. The desk is important for your revenue as without one, SCPs can not be tested on.</p>
<h2>'Parasite' Objects</h2>
<p>Currently, there are three parasite objects.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The old bed, which links into the toilet. This is a requirement for Class D to be put into your facility.</li>
  <li>The cafeteria table, which links into the kitchen buffet. This is a requirement for personnel and Class Ds to fulfill their hunger needs.</li>
  <li>The SCPs, which links into the desk. Once again, this is important for your revenue for testing to occur.</li>
</ol>
<h2>‘Isolate’ Objects</h2>
<p>There are currently 5 isolate objects.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The bed. Personnel sleep in this bed, and as such it does not require linking to anywhere else.</li>
  <li>The toilet. Even though it could be linked to an old bed, it could also function without linking, leaving personnel to use it.</li>
  <li>The Scientific Desk, or the Computer desk. Personnel use it to give higher earnings, and as such does not require linking.</li>
  <li>The metal detector. This object is only for security measures and for now does not require linking.</li>
  <li>The elevator. This object is only to move personnel and class D at the moment and does not require linking.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>The first version of linking was instead called “Zoning” which had objects placed inside zones, but the idea was scrapped.</p>
<p>(More Trivia soon)</p>
