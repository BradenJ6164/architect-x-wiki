<h2>Foundation Life-Cycle</h2>
<p>Your foundation has a game loop that determines many events. This section will outline the order of these events and the actions that will take place.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Class D Delivery</h3>
<p>The first event is the Class D delivery. This event will total up the current alive Class Ds issued to your foundation, and the amount of beds available to Class Ds. Should you have more beds than Class Ds issued, a Box Truck will soon dispatch the difference in Class Ds. Should a bed be deleted, the respective Class Ds will be automatically removed instantly.&nbsp;</p>
