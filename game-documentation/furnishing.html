<h1>Furnishing</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furnishing is a vital tool used for placing items that can be interacted with by personnel or is a requirement for specific links.</p>
<p>As of now, there are 9 available pieces of furniture that each have a specific function or reason. 5 out of the 9 pieces of furniture has additional styles, adding up to a total of 14 different furniture.</p>
<p>To tell whether or not furniture can be swapped to a different variant, check to see if there is a gear button in the bottom right:</p>
