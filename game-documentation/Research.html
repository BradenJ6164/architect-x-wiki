<h1>Research</h1>
<p>Research in SCP Architect X allows players to unlock new features within the game. Each feature unlock requires a certain amount of research stars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Research Tree</h3>
<p>The Research Tree is accessible by the microscope icon in the bottom left-center of the toolbar. It displays the amount of research stars you have and the features you can (or have) unlocked.</p>
