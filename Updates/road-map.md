- The entire facility will go on lockdown during a riot, testing will be paused, Class Ds might kill staff

## Breach Protocol [Planned]
- Humanoid SCPs (seperate research requirement) have a chance to breach depending on a variety of to be determined factors.
- The entire facility will go on lockdown during a breach, testing will be paused, the SCPs may kill staff

## Chaos Insurgency Raid [Planned]
